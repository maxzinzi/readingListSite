            I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA in a working-class home. 
            I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from Bucknell University in 1989.
            My interest in interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching was born at Bucknell 
            through my exposure to an array of extraordinary teachers in the Departments of History, Philosophy, Economics and English. 
            I went on to the University of California, Irvine and received my Ph.D. in 1997. While at Irvine, 
            I deepened my interdisciplinary training and refined a whole range of skills through my work in the Departments of History, Philosophy, French, English and Comparative Literature and the Program in Critical Theory. 
            Along the way, I had the opportunity to study and live in France and England. <br><br>
            Currently, I teach at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in the Department of Historical Studies; 
            I also offer courses in the Honors Program and in the Interdisciplinary Studies Program. 
            My teaching is largely organized around two broad interests: modern European intellectual history and the history of modern France. 
            Within those parameters, I often examine intersections of literature and philosophy, 
            using concepts drawn from philosophical texts to illuminate literature and the insights of literature to flesh out philosophical concepts. 
            The dialogues that organize my courses are also mirrored in my research. <br><br>
            My current research is organized around two nodes. First, I continue to explore a long-standing fascination with the oeuvre of Georges Bataille. 
            In particular, I have been interested in Bataille's theory and practice of history. 
            I have published on the insights Bataille's conceptualization of history can bring to contemporary debates about globalization. 
            I am currently working on an article that seeks to illuminate the resources Bataille can offer to the historical discipline at the beginning of the Twenty-First Century. 
            Second, through my teaching, I have come to have a passionate interest in friendship, its history and its political function. 
            I have published on the political unconscious of Herman Hesse's Narcissus and Goldmund, showing that the novel functioned as a warning of and challenge to the totalitarian tendencies of the late 1920's and early 1930's. 
            I am currently working on a parallel examination of Toni Morrison's Sula, trying to understand how the novel comments on the intersection of gender, race and power in the mid-twentieth century United States. 
            I hope, over the next years, to turn these discontinuous essays into a book on friendship and politics. <br> <br>
            That project will be slow in unfolding because I have, since May 2005, been engaged in the project of re-imagining and reforming the General Education Program at SIUE. 
            As Chair of the BRIDGE (Baccalaureate Reform through Integrated Design of General Education) Committee, much of my creative energy for the next few years will be directed towards helping to create a coherent, innovative and relevant General Education Program for SIUE.</p>
